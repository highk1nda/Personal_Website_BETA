# Personal_Website_BETA

## Description

Welcome to the open-source code repository for my published web application, [asatsuk.com](http://asatsuk.com). I have developed this website from scratch without using any external libraries. For the back-end, I utilized Flask, a micro web framework written in Python, to handle form data and provide clean URLs.

Get ready to explore my journey, skills, and more on my upcoming personal website! This space will reflect my experiences, education, and passion for all things tech. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to enhance and expand this project.
